Shine - Symbolic Regression Machine
-----------------------------------

This is a library under development, the first Release Candidate is about to be
released soon.

1) What is Shine ?

Shine is a library that automatically makes the code generation of the LLVM IR 
(Intermediate Representation) from Genetic Programming trees. It also provides
an easy API for optimizing and JIT to native code such Genetic Programming ASTs.

Shine follow this flow:

a. Load LLVM bitcode
    This LLVM bitcode can be from any language supported by the LLVM compiler
    infrastructure.
b. Load Genetic Programming trees
    In this phase, each node representing a non-terminal (a function) is resolved
    and matched again the previous loaded LLVM bitcode file.
c. Codegen the AST
    Shine converts this AST into LLVM IR.
d. Optimization
    Shine run LLVM optimization passes in the merged LLVM IR module representing
    each tree.
e. JIT
    Shine uses LLVM to convert this LLVM IR into native code and then returns
    a function pointer to that native function.

2) What license uses Shine ?

Shine is licensed under LPGL.

3) Language bindings ?

Python language bindings are under development, actually, Shine is a component of
a bigger project to use state-of-art compiler technology such as optimizations and
JIT compiling for a Genetic Programming system. In future, Pyevolve will use 
Shine to JIT its Genetic Programming trees into native code.
